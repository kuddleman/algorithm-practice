This is my readme file

What is recursion?
    A process, i.e. a function, that 
    calls itself.


Why do we need to know this?
It's found in:
    JSON.parse/JSON.stringify could be a recursive function

    document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms.

    Object traversal

    It's sometime a cleaner alternative to iteration
